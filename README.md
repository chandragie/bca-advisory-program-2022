## What's next?

The curricullum I prepared is obviously cover just the basics and not for production used. There are so many other things to learn and add for a bigger point of view of web development, and trust me, **it does not have a finish line**.

The key to be a better and better web developer each day is **never stop learning** because in this field, every hour passes some new things are created. 

We are dealing with a very fast pace, it is most likely we will not be able to keep up with that. My advice is, focus and be strong in the basic concepts, the radix, and do not FOMO, you're gonna stress yourself üòµ .

However, there are other things I have to add and they are also important for you to know:

- TDD
- PWA
- Debugging
- GraphQL
- CICD

## Closing

So that's it! Congratulations! üéâüéâüéâ You've finished the program.

Hope what I share can be useful stuffs for you to be a web developer.

Never stop learning and see you again! üëã
